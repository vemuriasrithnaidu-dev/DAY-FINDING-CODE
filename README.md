📌 Project Overview

The Day Finder Program is a console-based application developed in C language that calculates the day of the week for any given date (day, month, and year).

The program validates user input carefully, including leap year rules and correct number of days in each month. It ensures accuracy and allows re-entry when invalid data is provided.

This project is mainly designed for academic and learning purposes, helping students understand date calculations and input validation in C.
